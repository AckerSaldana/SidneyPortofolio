The site presented a unique paradox: it offered breathtaking views of the Kyoto hills but was constrained by steep topography and strict local building regulations."

      text: "We approached the design as a series of framed voids. Rather than imposing a solid mass onto the hillside, we carved out spaces for light and air to penetrate the structure. The use of raw concrete provides a stoic, timeless quality, while locally sourced timber adds warmth and tactile contrast."
